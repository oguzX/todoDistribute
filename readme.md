# Todo Dispatcher

I used  ROUND-ROBÄ°N algorithm for dispatch

> **Real Estimate Time** = *Level* x *Estimate Time*

What we should do to get started

    composer install
    doctrine:database:create
    doctrine:schema:update --force

And after that you should add couple developers to our developers table.

and as last thing the dispatcher command needs to be run
command name is

    task:fetch:dispatch
